# Metadata-Thing
a small applescript application to give you codec information from FFMPEG



this is a small drop in applescript that can grab metadata for video and audio files dropped to it. its not much, but it makes it easier for those who dont want to mess with the terminal all too much.

set up is simple, on macOS

install xcode command line tools
```
command xcode-select --install
```

install homebrew if you havent already
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

install ffmpeg
```
brew install ffmpeg
```

once thats done, download the latest zip from the releases tab, extract, and put it wherever its conveniant drag and drop as many files to the app as you would like!
